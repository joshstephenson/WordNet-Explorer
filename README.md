# WordNet Explorer

This is a basic word explorer for the dataset provided in project #6 of Princeton's Algorithms courses. While that project focuses on a shortest ancestral path problem, this project is a basic explorer of the data for the purpose of verifying data and data importing.

##### Enter any word in the search bar and you can explore it's ancestors and descendants.
